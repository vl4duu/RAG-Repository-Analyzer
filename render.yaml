      # NOTE: Do NOT auto-populate FRONTEND_URL or FRONTEND_ORIGINS from the frontend service here.
      # Doing so creates a circular dependency between the backend and frontend during deployment.
      #
      # After both services are deployed, you may manually set:
      # - FRONTEND_URL: the public URL of the static frontend (e.g., https://your-frontend.onrender.com)
      # - FRONTEND_ORIGINS: comma-separated list of allowed frontend origins for CORS
      #
      # Example (set via Render Dashboard after deploy):
      # FRONTEND_URL=https://rag-analyzer-frontend.onrender.com
      # FRONTEND_ORIGINS=https://rag-analyzer-frontend.onrender.com,https://www.yourdomain.com

      # Do NOT auto-reference the backend service URL here to keep deployments independent.
      # After deployment, you can manually configure the API URL for the frontend build
      # (via environment groups or static site settings) e.g.:
      # NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://rag-analyzer-api.onrender.com

      # Post-deploy steps (manual):
      # 1) Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL on the frontend to the backend's public URL.
      # 2) On the backend, switch API_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=false and configure FRONTEND_ORIGINS
      #    with the frontend's public URL(s) to tighten CORS.
